//. Create a class Account (in the example) to provide a method called debit that withdraws money from an
// Account. Ensure that the debit amount does not exceed the Accountâ€™s balance. If it does, the balance
// should be left unchanged and the method should print a message indicating ?Debit amount exceeded
// account balance. Write this program in dart.
